 - Built a automated task to inform my network what I'm working on LinkedIn.
 - Posts a automated report each month to my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nbj-mncube/) using [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions).
 - Additional functionality:
     - [] Keeps track of already posted project in .txt file
     - [] Emails me if I haven't at least created one project for the month
     - [] Attached record of projects for the year
